The KALX Promotions form allows promotions volunteers to create consistently themed promotions printouts for use by the on-air DJ. The tool does not currently have a backend to store the entered data, it merely renders the data into a PDF.

This tool was thrown together in April 2007 and I've not had time to go back and improve the code quality. It works but the code lacks modularity and separation of content and presentation.

The form can be used at http://www.kalxstaff.org/promotions/

There's a test page that fills out all the fields for rapid testing at http://www.kalxstaff.org/promotions/test.html
